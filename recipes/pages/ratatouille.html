        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ratatouille, not to be confused with the animated Pixar studios film of the same name, is a French dish consisting of various vegetables such as tomato, garlic, onion, courgette, and aubergine. Originating from the Provence region of France, it began as a peasants dish and ultimately worked its way up to starring on the menu of five star restaurants across the globe and being one of the country's most well known dishes. It is known to be a light and summery dish - perfect as an appetizer or an accompaniement to any meal. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
          <li>2 medium white onions</li>
          <li>3 medium courgette</li>
          <li>2 medium aubergine</li>
          <li>3 sweet red peppers</li>
          <li>3 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
          <li>6 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
          <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
          <li>2 large heirloom tomatoes</li>
          <li>2 small bay leaves</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
          <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
          <li>Smash and peel 3 garlic cloves, reserving the 4th. Halve onions through their roots, and slice halves into 1/4-inch-thick pieces. Slice zucchini into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Cut eggplant into 1-inch cubes or spears. Seed peppers, and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick strips.
          </li>
          <li>Spread each vegetable on a separate rimmed baking sheet. Add the 3 cloves of smashed garlic to the onion pan. Add 1 sprig rosemary and 2 sprigs thyme to each of the pepper, eggplant and zucchini pans. Sprinkle salt lightly over vegetables. Drizzle 3 tablespoons olive oil on each of the pans.</li>
          <li>Place all the pans in the oven. Cook until vegetables are very tender and lightly browned at the edges. Shake or stir the pans every 15 to 20 minutes or so, especially the onions.</li>
          <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add tomatoes and blanch until the skins split, about 10 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to quickly transfer the tomatoes to a bowl filled with ice water.</li>
          <li>Peel the cooled tomatoes. Halve tomatoes across their equators. Set a sieve over a bowl. Working over the bowl, use your fingers to seed the tomatoes, letting the seeds catch in the sieve and the juice run into the bowl. Discard seeds but save juices. Dice tomatoes and add to the reserved juices in bowl.</li>
          <li>Finely grate or mince remaining garlic clove. Add garlic to tomatoes along with bay leaves and a large pinch of salt.</li>
          <li>Once vegetables are done cooking, combine them on one baking sheet or a large shallow baking dish and add ingredients from tomato bowl. Toss well.</li>
          <li>Cover generously with olive oil, using remaining Â¼ cup oil or more, and sprinkle with salt. Cook at least 1 hour, stirring every 15 to 20 minutes, until vegetables are very tender and imbued with juices and oil. Add salt and pepper to taste, then serve warm, or let cool.</li>
        </ol>
